A new League of Legends Match History webapp that will allow users to filter their match history not only based on champion or queue (all other sites do that already),
but also rune keystone, matchup, and even items bought, and it will display your winrate across how many games it found that matches the filters. 
I have looked everywhere for a site that already does this, but I couldn't find one, so I'm making one (:
